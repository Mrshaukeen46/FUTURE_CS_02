## 🔍 Overview
This repository contains the deliverables for **Cyber Security Task 2: Security Operations Center (SOC) Internship Project**.  
The project simulates real-world **Security Alert Monitoring and Incident Response** processes performed by SOC Analysts.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Monitor and analyze simulated **SIEM logs**
- Identify and classify **security incidents**
- Prepare a professional **Incident Response Report**
- Simulate **SOC dashboard** and alert review
- Draft a **communication email** for management

---

## 🧠 Skills Gained
- Log analysis and event correlation  
- Understanding of SIEM dashboards (Splunk / ELK)  
- Incident classification and severity assessment  
- SOC workflow: triage → escalation → containment  
- Professional cybersecurity reporting and documentation

## 🧩 Incident Response Process
1. **Detection** — Identify alerts and extract logs from SIEM dashboard.  
2. **Analysis** — Verify anomalies, correlate IPs, and evaluate event patterns.  
3. **Classification** — Assign severity (High/Medium/Low).  
4. **Response** — Contain affected systems, block malicious IPs, patch vulnerabilities.  
5. **Recovery** — Restore system operations and validate patch success.  
6. **Reporting** — Prepare and communicate findings to management.
